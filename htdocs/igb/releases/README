# IGB release process - Manual #

1) Create new directory for release here.

2) Add release artifacts into release directory, including:

* IGB_macos_M_N_P.dmg    
* IGB_windows_M_N_P.exe
* IGB_windows_x64_M_N_P.exe
* IGB_unix_M_N_P.sh    
* md5sums
* updates.xml
* optional/[app]-M-N-P.jar

Release artifacts are in Downloads section of:

https://bitbucket.org/lorainelab/integrated-genome-browser

Note: Installers (dmg, exe files) need to have been build with 
correct codeBaseUrl setting in Install4J configuration file. To
test that the update process is working as expected, re-rebuild
intallers using address of test server. 
 
3) Create symbolic links in release directory:

e.g., 

IGB_macos_current.dmg -> IGB_macos_9_0_1.dmg
IGB_unix_current.sh -> IGB_unix_9_0_1.sh
IGB_windows_current.exe -> IGB_windows_9_0_1.exe
IGB_windows-x64_current.exe -> IGB_windows-x64_9_0_1.exe

BioViz Web pages point to these symbolic links to avoid hard-coding
release numbers.

4) Update igb/current to point to new release directory

Now, anyone with IGB already installed will be asked to
update their installation when they launch IGB.

5) Edit downloads.html to indicate the new release.
